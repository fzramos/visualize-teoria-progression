# Visualize your Music Interval Training
- Teoria.com is a website which provides customized music interval training. It also allows users to save their exercises and scores.  Unfornately, these training statistics are only represented in a tabular format which limits a users understanding of their training progess which may lead to inefficient or all together ineffective training going unnoticed.
- The goal of this project is to consume a users Teoria training data and produce informative and interactive visualizations. These graphs will give a user a better understanding of the success of their musical training and help them make better choices in training regiments. 
- The users training data will be webscrapped with Python and Selenium
- Interactive visualizations will be created with Plotly Dash.
